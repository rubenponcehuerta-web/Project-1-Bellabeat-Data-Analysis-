Case Study: Bellabeat Smart Device Data Analysis ⌚
Author: Rubén Antonio Ponce Huerta

Tools: Microsoft Excel (Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboards).

1. Executive Summary
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. This project analyzes smart device fitness data to identify trends in user behavior, providing actionable insights for the marketing team to unlock new growth opportunities.

2. Business Task
Identify how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to inform the marketing strategy for the Bellabeat app and products.

3. Data Processing & Analysis (Excel Workflow)
I used the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain) to perform the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Used Excel to remove duplicates, format dates, and ensure data integrity across 30 unique users.

Pivot Tables: Created multiple pivot tables to segment data by:

Total steps vs. Calories burned.

Average activity minutes per day of the week.

Sleep duration vs. Time spent in bed.

Analysis: Identified that users are most active during specific "peak hours" and that there is a significant drop-off in tracking on weekends.

4. Key Visualizations
(Note: These charts were developed directly in Excel using Pivot Charts)

A. Activity Trends
The analysis shows a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned, but also reveals that users tend to be more sedentary than recommended for long periods.

B. Sleep Patterns
Many users spend more time in bed than actually sleeping, suggesting an opportunity for Bellabeat to offer sleep-improvement features.

5. Marketing Recommendations
"Weekend Warrior" Campaign: Focus marketing on motivating users to maintain activity levels during Saturdays and Sundays.

Smart Sleep Alerts: Use app notifications to help users transition to sleep mode, addressing the "time in bed" gap found in the data.

Activity Reminders: Implement reminders during mid-day lulls to encourage more consistent movement throughout the day.
